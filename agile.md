# Agile & Good Practices in Projects

## Estimation & Planning
- How do you estimate tasks? What estimation techniques do you know, which ones do you use, and why?
- There is a challenging task that nobody in the team has done before. How would you estimate it accurately?
- You know that not all committed user stories will be delivered. How would you handle this situation?
- How do you understand and track the velocity of your team?
- How do you define "done" at the level of a user story, sprint, and project?
- What is a spillover in Scrum? How do you avoid it?

## Team Structure & Delegation
- In your opinion, what is the ideal team structure and why?
- What tasks do you delegate? What criteria do you use to safely delegate critical tasks?
- How do you ensure that junior or introverted engineers understand their tasks and responsibilities?

## Quality & Delivery
- There is a codebase developed by more than 10 developers. What steps would you take to ensure high-quality deliverables?
- The client has rejected several user story implementations due to unclear expectations. How would you prevent similar situations in the future?
- How do you incorporate best practices (TDD, code reviews, CI/CD) to maintain high quality?
- How do you ensure that sprint or release goals are achievable without compromising quality?

## Risk Management
