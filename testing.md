# Testing Interview Questions

## Testing Concepts
- What is the difference between TDD (Test-Driven Development) and BDD (Behavior-Driven Development)?
- Explain the TDD cycle (Red → Green → Refactor).
- What is the difference between white-box and black-box testing?

- What is the purpose of mocking in tests?
- Explain the difference between stub, mock, and spy.
- Can you mock final classes with Mockito? What about static methods?

## Legacy Code & Coverage
- What would you do if you have to change legacy code with no tests? How would you proceed?
- How would you define good test coverage?
- How do you measure code coverage and what tools can you use (JaCoCo, Cobertura, Istanbul)?
- How do you ensure your tests are maintainable and readable?
- How do you write tests for code that depends on external systems (DB, APIs)?

## Testing Best Practices
- How do you organize test suites and test classes?
- How do you handle flaky tests?
- How do you ensure tests run fast and efficiently?
- How do you test asynchronous or multi-threaded code?
- How do you write parameterized tests?
- How do you integrate tests into CI/CD pipelines?
- How do you test exception handling and edge cases?
- How do you decide what to mock and what to use as a real implementation?
- How do you test code for performance or load (stress tests, load tests)?

## Tools & Frameworks
- Which testing frameworks do you use (JUnit, TestNG, Spock, etc.)?
- Which mocking frameworks do you use (Mockito, PowerMock, EasyMock)?
- How do you perform integration testing in Java (Spring Test, TestContainers)?
- How do you perform end-to-end testing or UI testing (Selenium, Cypress, Playwright)?
